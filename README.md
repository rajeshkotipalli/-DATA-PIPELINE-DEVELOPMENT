# -DATA-PIPELINE-DEVELOPMENT

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: K RAJESH

*INTERN ID*: CTO4DG2597 

*DOMAIN*:DATA SCIENCE

*DURATION*:4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*:NEELA SANTHOSH

*During my internship, one of the core tasks I worked on was designing and implementing a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and essential data science libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn. This project was not just about writing code ‚Äî it helped me understand the real-world challenges of handling raw data and preparing it for machine learning and analytics use cases.

The goal was to automate the process of:

Extracting raw data from a .csv file

Transforming the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical ones

Loading the cleaned data into a new .csv file ‚Äî ready for ML models or business intelligence tools

üîß Tools & Technologies Used:
Python 3

Pandas ‚Äì for data manipulation and file operations

Scikit-learn ‚Äì to build preprocessing pipelines (imputers, encoders, scalers)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code ‚Äì for development

CSV files ‚Äì used as both input and output data sources

üìå Key Features of the ETL Pipeline I Built:
Used SimpleImputer to handle missing values:

Mean strategy for numerical columns

Most frequent strategy for categorical columns

Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical values

Used OneHotEncoder to convert categorical text into numerical format

Combined all transformations using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline

Final transformed output was saved using Pandas into a clean .csv file

This pipeline ensures that data is consistent, clean, and ready for any machine learning model or reporting dashboard. It's reusable and scalable ‚Äî meaning the same script can be used on other datasets with minimal tweaks.

üè¢ Where This Task Is Applicable:
Data Science & Machine Learning Projects
Before you train a model, your data has to be in the right shape. This ETL process prepares it.

Business Intelligence (BI) Reports
BI dashboards like Power BI or Tableau expect clean input. This helps generate accurate insights.

Enterprise Data Pipelines
In large companies, such scripts are automated to run daily for financial or operational reports.

Real-time analytics systems
Preprocessing pipelines like this are the backbone of any smart data product.

 Challenges I have  faced:
File Not Found & Permission Errors
Initially, I struggled with incorrect file paths, especially when running scripts on different machines or folders. I learned how to use strip() and full path techniques to handle it smoothly.

Version Compatibility
I encountered an error with OneHotEncoder, specifically that the sparse argument was not accepted. I researched and realized my scikit-learn version had updated, and I had to use sparse_output=False. It taught me always to check documentation and version compatibility.

Column Naming After Encoding
After transformation, getting the actual column names (especially for encoded features) was tricky. I learned how to use get_feature_names_out() for cleaner output.

Understanding Pipelines & Transformers
Combining multiple steps into a single pipeline was a challenge at first. But once I understood how ColumnTransformer splits the tasks between numeric and categorical features, it became powerful.

what i learned:
I now understand the importance of clean data and how much work goes behind the scenes before modeling even starts.

I learned how to use industry-standard tools and best practices for data preprocessing.

It gave me confidence that I can now work on real-world data projects and not just basic classroom examples.

This internship task gave me a hands-on look at what happens in real data projects and helped me move from a beginner coder to a problem-solving developer. I‚Äôm proud of completing this ETL pipeline, and it's something I can reuse in my future data science projects and even improve further by adding automation, validation, or data visualization.
